This repo contains the main files of my capstone project for a cloud computing course.
The three directories represent three different servers hosted on AWS.
* ann: annotates genomics data by processing requests from a message queue
* web: hosts the endpoints for requesting annotation jobs and managing user settings
* util: manages data archival and email notifications
